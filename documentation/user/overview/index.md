# OneOps Continuous Lifecycle

With OneOps, your design becomes much more than a simple template. It's a
continually maintained dataset where the notion of change is always recognized.

In fact, OneOps was created from the ground up to manage the issues that arise with
continuous change. In addition, OneOps automatically scales and repairs your
application to ensure high availability and optimal utilization of your cloud infrastructure.

# OneOps Lifecycle Phases

![OneOps Product Overview](/assets/docs/local/images/oneops-product-overview.png)

OneOps streamlines the three phases of the lifecycle â€“ **design, transition** and **operations.**

## Design Phase

![Basic Introduction Continuous Lifecycle Design](/assets/docs/local/images/basic-introduction-continuous-lifecycle-design.png)

Define your application workload based on your architectural and application requirements.

* Visually assemble your application
* Select from a library of platform packs
* Fine-tune components inside each platform
* Modify your design with version control

## Transition Phase

![Basic Introduction Transition Lifecycle Transition](/assets/docs/local/images/basic-introduction-continuous-lifecycle-transition.png)

Provision environments by mapping the design output against operational requirements.

* Create and customize multiple environments
* Specify availability requirements
* Bind to your cloud provider of choice
* Deploy with effortless automation

## Operations Phase

![Basic Introduction Continuous Lifecycle Operations](/assets/docs/local/images/basic-introduction-continuous-lifecycle-operations.png)

Monitor and control your environments to maintain the required operational levels.

* Monitor the health of your application
* View configuration, metrics and logs
* Enable auto repair, auto scale and auto replace
* Perform manual control actions
