A OneOps __developer__ carries out __modifications__ of existing aspects of OneOps __or adds new aspects__. Typical
developer activities are:

- __Core development__: Development on any component of the __OneOps application__ stack itself
- __Content development__: Creation and maintenance of __OneOps packs__ and __circuits__.
- __Integrations development__:  Usage of the __OneOps API__ to create integrations with other applications or workflows

Available resources for developers include:

- [Key Concepts](/developer/key-concepts): Key concepts for OneOps administrators.
- [Getting Started](/developer/getting-started): Installation instructions.
- [Administrator Index](/developer/developer-index.html): Index of all relevant administrator documentation.
- [All source code on GitHub]({{ site.github_url }})

At a minimum a developer needs to understand the basic concepts of [OneOps itself](/general/about.html) and
for [OneOps users](/user/overview/). Depending on the development task, [OneOps administrator](/admin/overview)
knowledge is potentially required as well.
