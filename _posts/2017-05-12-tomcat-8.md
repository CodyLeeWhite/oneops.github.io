The `tomcat` pack provides version 7.x and 8.5.x of the
[Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) web application server and is a very
popular pack for OneOps users running Java-powered web applications. With the
[recent release](/general/blog/2017-02-16-oneops-release-170216stable.html) we
are bringing you an important update to the pack.
 
<!--more-->
 
The pack is updated to include Tomcat version 8.5.12 allowing users to switch to
Servlet Specification 3.1 if required.  *Please see below for special
consideration when upgrading from earlier versions to version 8.5.12*
 
We have also deprecated the `mirrors` attribute of the `tomcat` component. If
the attribute is empty we will now use the mirror service of the cloud.  All
users are encouraged to remove any mirrors they have defined.  If defined the
`tomcat` component will continue to use that attribute for backwards
compatibility.
 
We have also deprecated `build version` in favor of one drop down for version
since build version and major version are tied together.  You will see
deprecation notices in the UI for this attribute as well as deprecated major
versions where required. These elements will be removed at a future release but
will continue to work with this release.  Users are encouraged to move to a
version that is not deprecated.
 
 
## Special considerations when upgrading to 8.5.12

If you are upgrading from tomcat 7.0.x to 8.5.12 please note that the pack
contains a hardcoding of the major version on the `tomcat` directory.  So if you
are using tomcat 7.0 this will end up making the directory `tomcat7`; when
upgrading to 8.5.12 this hardcoding will still exist due to legacy constraints.
Users should consider reviewing their `tomcat`, `artifact`, and `daemon`
components to ensure that any reference to `tomcat7` is updated to `tomcat8`.
Please be aware that other components may also have this constraint and that
testing in lower environments is encouraged.
