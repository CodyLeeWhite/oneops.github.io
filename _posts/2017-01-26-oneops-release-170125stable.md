In addition to celebrating [one year OneOps as open source project](/general/blog/2017-01-25-one-year-open-source.html)
we are giving you another release. This time we focused on polishing what we delivered with the
[large release earlier this month](/general/blog/2017-01-05-oneops-release-170105stable.html). But, as usual, we also
added a few new things.
