OneOps is a complex application with many components and interactions as you can see in the
[key concepts documentation](../general/key-concepts.html). As a result installation is potentially a complicated
process.

The installation process is simplified by alternative methods to bootstrap you OneOps deployment: 

<ul>
<li><a href="../../developer/core-development/index.html">Building OneOps from source including creation of VM via Vagrant</a></li>
<li><a href="./install-with-vagrant.html">Install OneOps on a VM installed by Vagrant</a></li>
<!--<li><a href="./install-with-ami.html">Install OneOps in Amazon EC2 via an Amazon Machine Image AMI</a></li>-->
</ul>


From that initial install you can then to proceed to successfully operating OneOps for you users including

- [Manage OneOps with OneOps](../operate/oneops-manages-oneops.html)
- [Upgrade OneOps](../operate/upgrading-one-ops.html)
- [Running OneOps in Production](../operate/running-oneops-in-production.html)

and others.
