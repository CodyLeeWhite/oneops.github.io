OneOps is a complex application with many components and interactions as you can see in the
[key concepts documentation](../general/key-concepts.html). As a result installation is potentially a complicated
process.

The installation process is simplified by alternative methods to bootstrap you OneOps deployment: 

- [Install OneOps on a VM installed by Vagrant](./install-with-vagrant.html)
- [Install OneOps in Amazon EC2 via an Amazon Machine Image AMI](./install-with-ami.html)

From that initial install you can then to proceed to successfully operating OneOps for you users including

- [Manage OneOps with OneOps](../operate/oneops-manages-oneops.html)
- [Upgrade OneOps](../operate/upgrading-one-ops.html)
- [Running OneOps in Production](../operate/running-oneops-in-production.html)

and others.
