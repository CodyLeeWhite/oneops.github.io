# Solution

To fix an unresponsive compute, follow these steps to reboot the compute:


1. Issues a reboot action from the operations of the compute component.

2. If the compute does not respond after the reboot, replace the compute. For instructions on how to replace a compute, go to <a href="/user/howto/replace-a-bad-vm.html">Replace a Bad VM</a>.
3. If it is not an option to replace the compute, contact your OneOps administrator for further assistance to bring the node up.
