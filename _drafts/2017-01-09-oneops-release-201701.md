We are kicking off the year 2017 with a release that brings a host of new features and bug fixes after slowing down a bit in [Q4 2016](/general/blog/2016-12-28-oneops-releases-2016-q4.html). And there are
some significant ones like support for the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), various
improvements for Windows computes and a number of UI enhancements.

And we are not slowing down either. The next release is already in the pipeline with numerous merges pending. But
let's not get ahead of ourselves. Check out what is in the new  `17.01.05-STABLE` release first.
