Exactly one year ago today, OneOps became
[available to the open source community](http://www.walmartlabs.com/2016/01/oneops-now-available/). It has been a great
journey since then. Some things stayed the same, other things changed. We learned a lot and we are still in the process
of improving everything for you all and getting better at working with everyone out there. But let's look back and see
what we have accomplished.

Working up to the initial open source release and afterwards we get a lot of traction
[in the press](/general/in-the-press.html) and we followed up on that with various team members attending conferences
and other events and presenting about OneOps and various use cases we encounter daily.

In terms of the code we certainly did not keep still either over the year. We released nearly __40 new versions__ of
OneOps including many improvements on the user interface and the various core components of OneOps. We also added many
new packs for supporting new applications and frameworks and improved the existing ones. Check out the release notes in
the [OneOps Team Blog](/blog) for more details. Just in this short month alone we created two significant release adding
things such as Google Cloud Platform support, Windows compute support and others -
[17.01.05-STABLE](/general/blog/2017-01-05-oneops-release-170105stable.html) and [17.01.xx](tbd).
